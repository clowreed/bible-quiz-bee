          You can play either by connecting your MetaMask wallet or logging in
          as guest. If you choose to connect your wallet, you can claim BIBLE
          tokens and NFT badges. You will not get any NFTs and tokens if you
          login as guest.
        </li>
        <li>Enter your username and then click on Start Game to begin</li>

          There are three levels of difficulty to finish. Easy, Medium and
          Difficult. If you manage to pass each level, you will be able to
          unlock the next level and claim some tokens and NFTs.

          You will begin with 5 hearts and for every mistake, you will lose a
          heart. If you consume all 5 hearts then the game will end and you will
          have to start over again. You will only be able to claim tokens and
          NFTs when you clear a level so be careful.
